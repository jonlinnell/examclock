# examclock
A simple display clock for timing exams (or any other event that requires a clock on display and preset timing.)

## Usage
Install dependencies
```shell
yarn
```
or
```shell
npm install
```
... if that's your thing.

You can test the app with
```shell
yarn start
```

... and you can create a production build in the *dist* directory with
```shell
yarn build
```

## Customisation

Colours can be customised in the *src/styles/colours.scss* file. There are plans for more extensive customisation and branding options in the future.
